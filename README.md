This repository contains a simple Rust program that illustrates a common error involving mutable and immutable references.  The `bug.rs` file shows the original code with a commented-out line that would cause a compile-time error. The `bugSolution.rs` file doesn't contain any error and it is just the `bug.rs` file without any error.  The program demonstrates how Rust's borrowing system prevents data races by disallowing modification of a value through an immutable reference.  This example helps beginners understand the importance of careful reference management in Rust.
